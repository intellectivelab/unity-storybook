    2. Put encrypted string into your ~/.npmrc file (create if absent)
        ```text
        email=ichukanov@intellective.com 
        always-auth=true 
        _auth=INSERT_ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD_HERE
        ```
        **Note: .npmrc should be in the user home directory.**
    3. Run command, 
        ```sh
        npm set @intellective:registry https://npm.intellective.com/repository/npm-main/
